Selenium Class 6

Alerts:
Alert is a pop up message. Alert takes complete focus of our main page that we are working on
We cannot proceed until it is handled

3 types of Alerts:
1. web based alerts/ html alerts - we can simply inspect and perform needed actions
2. JavaScript alerts/ browser alerts - we can handle these alerts by using switchTo method
                                        we cannot inspect
3. Windows based alerts - we cannot handle with selenium

Types of JavaScript alerts:
1. Simple Alert - click ok
2. confirmation alert - either cancel or click ok
3. prompt alert - enter text and then click ok

To handle JS alerts we only have 4 methods
1. accept() - click ok
2. dismiss() - click cancel
3. getText()
4. sendKeys()


To handle authentication alerts we need to pass username and password in the URL
https://admin:admin@the-internet.herokuapp.com/basic_auth
     //username:password@

Frames:
Frame is a separate independent window in our webpage
frames allow devs to represent multiple views on one page

3 ways to interact with Frames:
1. by index
2. by name or ID
3. by WebElement

in alerts - switch manually to alert and switch automatically back
in frames - switch manually to a frame and switch manually back to the main page
